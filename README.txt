## Setup Instructions

1. Create an Environment Variable File:
   - In the main folder of this project, create a new file named `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and add the following line:
     ```
     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```
   - Replace `your-api-key` with your actual Anthropic API key.

2. Run the Application:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project's main folder.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     python app.py
     ```

3. Access the Application:
   - Once the program starts, you'll see output in the terminal.
   - Look for a line that provides a local server address (usually something like `[http://127.0.0.1:5000`](http://127.0.0.1:5000`/)).
   - Open this address in your web browser to access the application.

## Notes
- Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed before running the application.
- Keep your API key confidential and do not share it publicly.
